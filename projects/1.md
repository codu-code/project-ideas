# HTML Boilerplate generator

**Tier:** Beginner/Intermediate

The application is a page where users can select some default settings/libraries to have a boilerplate HTML page generated.

The purpose of the application is so newcomers can have some best practices without wasting hours on setup.

We could host this entirely on Netlify or GitHub page.
