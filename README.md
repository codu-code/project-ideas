The Cod√∫ Community plans on being big :fish: in the OSS community.

Let's work together to brain storm and work together on projects to make each other better engineers, people and a fun place to be.

Ideas can be as simple as cheatsheets to production applications.

Each should project have the following **features**:

1. A clear and descriptive objective;
2. All the resources and links to help you find what you need to start the project



## Projects

Projects are divided into three tiers based on the knowledge and experience
required to complete them.

## Contribution

Any contributions are highly appreciated. :pray: You can contribute in two ways:

1. create an issue and tell us your idea :bulb:. Make sure that you use the **new idea** label in this case;
2. fork the project and submit a PR with your new idea. Before doing that, please make sure that you read and follow the [Contribution Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md);
